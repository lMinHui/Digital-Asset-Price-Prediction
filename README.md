Bitcoin Price Movement Prediction

## Problem Statement
How may we predict the next day's price movement of BTC based on various information?

## Datasets Sources
Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, Mendeley Data

## Approach
* Explored the impact of different information/indicators (Technical indicators, News, Tweets, S&P 500, US Interest Rate) on BTC prices
* Models explored include Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, LSTM
* Shortlisted the most impactful variables and models 
* Between stacking approach and approach of combining selected features into 1 model, the latter approach yielded better results. Models were evaluated based on their F1 scores on backtested dataset for a fair comparison.
